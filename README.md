# Blockchain-Based Commercial Lease Administration Protocol

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Commercial Lease Administration (BCLA) protocol introduces a decentralized framework for managing commercial real estate leases. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, this protocol enhances transparency, reduces administrative overhead, and automates critical lease management functions.

## Core Components

### Property Verification Contract
This foundational contract validates ownership details and essential property information. It creates an immutable record of property specifications, legal descriptions, and ownership histories that serve as the basis for lease operations.

### Lease Terms Contract
Managing the complete lifecycle of commercial leases, this contract maintains critical dates, obligations, and conditions. It automatically tracks lease commencement, expiration, renewal options, and notification periods, triggering actions at predetermined milestones.

### Rent Escalation Contract
This contract automates the calculation of rent increases based on predefined formulas and external data sources. It supports various escalation methods including CPI adjustments, fixed percentage increases, and market rate revisions.

### Compliance Tracking Contract
Designed to monitor adherence to lease covenants, this contract tracks tenant and landlord obligations such as insurance requirements, maintenance responsibilities, and use restrictions. It issues notifications when compliance issues are detected.
